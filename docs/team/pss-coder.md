### Project: Friend Book

FriendBook is a desktop application for managing your contact details.
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
It is written in Java and has over 10kLOC.

Given below are my contributions to this project.

* **New Feature**: Added the Reminder Service Capability.
  * What it does: Behind the UI, there is a background thread that periodically checks if a friend birthday is coming in a week or less.
  * Justification: This feature enables the user to get reminded of friends birthday without needing to remember the friends' birthday. The application does it for the user.
  * Highlights: These enhancements requires more analysis on backgrounds threads and how it packages together with the current codebase.
  * Credits: *Implementation idea came from [here](https://edencoding.com/periodic-background-tasks/)*.
