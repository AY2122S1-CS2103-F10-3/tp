**AddressBook is a desktop application for managing your contact details.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using AddressBook, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing AddressBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
* If you would like to see a demo video of our recent release (**v1.3**) as well, click [**here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pv8B4VA2RqWFHw22s6fveB5bnP9Afjti/view?usp=sharing) to see.
